The Robotics & AI laboratory is situated in A307. The laboratory provides access to the 
Augmented Reality laboratory and the TinyML laboratory. It represents important teaching and 
research resource and it is important to maintain the integrity of the equipment, fixtures, and 
fittings in the laboratory so that they are available for students, faculty, and any other person
authorized to use the facilities, including visitors who may wish to view the work carried out in
the laboratory.

Our research spans the following areas:
- Robotics
- Augmented Reality & Virtual Reality
